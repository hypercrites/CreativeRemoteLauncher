A dirty workarround for the start-button on SoundBlaster remotes


I have a Creative SB X-Fi Surround 5.1 USB with a remote with wich i am able to start the _Creative Entertainment Center_,
wich is REALLY old, even when the name of kodi was XBMC.

But there was no option to set my own application to start when i press the button on my remote.
I decided to write a batch-file, wich i later converted to an .exe 
(because i am lazy and don't know how to create a working windows executable anyway).
__The batch-file (or the .exe) runs a command to start Kodi from another (default) folder.__

I don't know wich tool i used to convert it, but i will include both files here.
the one batch-file wich you can edit when your installationfolders are changed, and the .exe for lazy people like me,
if you didn't changed any installation-folders of course.

Put "EC.exe" in the Entertainment Center Folder here:
> C:\Program Files (x86)\Creative\Entertainment Center
